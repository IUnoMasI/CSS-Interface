                <p class="paragraph">
                    Taffy is one of the most fun, interactive candies to make in our opinion. 
                <br> Many of the most famous taffy makers still use the same pulling process that dates back over 100 years! 
                <br>Talk about tradition! Most taffy is made from a combination of sugar, butter, and some type of vegetable oil that is boiled together to create a sticky, gooey mixture. 
                <br>Once it’s removed from the pan, flavour and food colouring are added and then the mixture is left to cool on a flat surface. 
                <br>After the taffy is cooled, that’s when the work begins! The taffy must be pulled, meaning the taffy must be folded and stretched, over and over again. 
                <br>This process aerates the candy, making it lighter and fluffier so that it is easier for us to chew! The taffy will get harder as it cools, then it needs to be stretched into a long rope and cut into pieces.
